Problem A - belonging of a point to a circle
Penalty for the parcel:	1
Time limit: 1s
Real time limit: 1s
Memory limit: 64M
Given the coordinates of a point and the radius of a circle centered at the origin of the coordinates. Determine if this
 point belongs to a circle. Recall that a circle is a part of the plane,
  consisting of all points of the circle and all points lying within the circle.

The format of the input data is
Three integers on one line: point coordinate on x-axis, point coordinate on y-axis, radius of circle r (r > 0).

Output format
Output "YES" without quotes, if the point belongs to the circle, "NO" without quotes otherwise.

Problem B-Bank deposit
Run penalty: 1
Time limit: 1 s
Real time limit: 1 s
Memory limit: 64M
The deposit in the bank is x rubles. Every year it is increased by p percent, after which the fractional
 part of the kopecks is discarded. Each year the sum of the deposit increases. You have to determine in
  how many years the deposit will be at least y rubles.

Input data format
Three natural numbers: x, p, y.

The format of the output
Number of years after how many years the deposit will be at least y rubles.

Problem C-Maximum number of consecutive 1s
Run penalty: 1
Time limit: 1 s
Real time limit: 1 s
Memory limit: 64M
You're given a sequence of 0's and 1's only. You're looking for the maximal number of consecutive 1's
(with no 0 between them).

The format of the input data
The first line of the input consists of a natural number N<=10000 , the length of the array, followed by N numbers
 0 or 1, the elements of the array. Each number is entered on a new line.

Output format
One number is the result.

# --------------------------|D|----------------------------------------------------

Submit a solution for D-Processing an array of numbers
Run penalty: 1
Time limit: 1 s
Real time limit: 1 s
Memory limit: 64M
At input the program gets a set of numbers ending with a grid. You need to find: the average, maximum and minimum
 numbers in the sequence. You also need to print the sum of remainders from dividing
  the sum of threes by the last number of threes (every 3 entered numbers make a threesome).

To understand, let's look at an example of input data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 average: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 3.5 maximum:
 6 minimum: 1 sum of residuals of threes: (1 + 2 + 3) mod 3 + (4 + 5 + 6) mod 6 = 6 mod 3 + 15 mod 6 = 0 + 3 = 3

Output the average by rounding to three decimal places. To do this, use the function round(x, 3).

Your program should output: 3.5 6 1 3

Consider whether it makes sense to store the whole sequence.

The format of the input
A sequence of numbers ending with '#'. All numbers from 1 to 100. The number of numbers in the sequence is
 a multiple of three. One number per line.

Output format
Four numbers separated by a space.

Problem E-Results of students' work during the semester
Run penalty: 1
Time limit: 1 s
Real time limit: 1 s
Memory limit: 64M
There is a semester's worth of student work. Print the students in order of their grade summation.
 You want to output the sorted work results for each student.

The data is entered as: student_id value

student_id takes on values from 0 to N. value 1 to 10

An example of input data: 0 3 0 5 1 3 1 2

This presents the data for two students, 0 and 1. The sum of the scores of student 0 is 8. Student 1's score is 5.
 So the scores of student 0 should be printed first, then student 1.
  So the sorted results of student 0 should be printed first, then student 1:

5 3 3 2

Recall that list in python has a built-in sort method and has a sorted function.
They have a key parameter that determines which values the object will be sorted by.
 For example, the code below will sort the list by the length of its elements. There is also the parameter reverse.

a = ['###', '@', '??'] a.sort(key=lambda x: len(x)) a ['@', '??', '###']
 a.sort(key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True) ['###', '??', '@']

You'll learn what a lambda function is later on (there's always the google site as well).
 To do this assignment, all you have to do is understand what the len function should be replaced with.

The format of the input data
The first line N is the number of students.
 Then comes some number of lines (not equal to N) with student results in the format:
  student_id value. 0 <= student_id < N.
   The values are separated by a space. The input ends with #.

Output format
Print the sorted student results on one line.
 Print the scores of the highest scoring student first, then the second highest, and so on. Single line results

Task F-Chocolate
Penalty for the parcel:	1
Time Limit: 1s
Real time limit: 1s
Memory limit: 64M
Sasha, didn't do his homework, but bought a chocolate bar. And, foolishly, he started to print it out right in class...
 The teacher heard the rustling of the candy. She wanted to call his parents to school, but Sasha persuaded
  her not to call them, but to give them an extra assignment.

The teacher took a close look at the chocolate bar (it was the size of 3x4 bars), divided it into pieces of two bars
 and treated everyone who did their homework. She asked Sasha to write a program which determines how many ways
  there are to divide a 3Ã—N chocolate bar into two pieces.

Sasha needs help to complete the task.

Note: all the pieces in the chocolate bar are numbered, so the ways of dividing the chocolate bars
symmetric to a point or to an axis can be different.

Input format.
At the input there is one number N <= 10000

Output format
Print one number, the number of ways to divide the candy bar.

Problem G-Stage of a String
Penalty for the parcel:	1
Time Limit: 1s
Real time limit: 1s
Memory limit: 64M
Let a string s be given. Let call its k-th (k > 0) degree s^k string s^k = sss (k times). For example,
 the third degree of string abc is string abcabc.

The root of degree k of string s is such a string t (if it exists) that t^k = s.

Your task is to write a program that finds the degree or root of a string.

Input data format
The input to the program is 2 strings. The first contains the string S and the second contains the power of k.
 A negative power means taking the root of the corresponding power.

Output format
Print the string which contains the answer to the problem. If there is no such string, print 'NO SOLUTION'
 (without quotes).
